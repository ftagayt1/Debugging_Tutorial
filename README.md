# C++ Debugging Tutorial with GDB and Valgrind

This tutorial provides two C++ programs with intentional bugs to help you learn debugging with GDB and Valgrind.

## Files Overview

1. **`logic_error_example.cpp`** - Contains logic errors that can be found by stepping through code with GDB
2. **`memory_leak_example.cpp`** - Contains memory leaks that can be detected with Valgrind
3. **`Makefile`** - Simplifies compilation and debugging commands

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:
- `g++` (GNU C++ compiler)
- `gdb` (GNU debugger)
- `valgrind` (memory error detector)

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install g++ gdb valgrind
```

## Quick Start

1. **Compile both programs:**
   ```bash
   make all
   ```

2. **Run the logic error example:**
   ```bash
   ./logic_error_example
   ```

3. **Run the memory leak example:**
   ```bash
   ./memory_leak_example
   ```

## Debugging with GDB

### Logic Error Example

The `logic_error_example.cpp` contains three functions with logic errors:

1. **findMax function**: Starts loop from index 1 and initializes `max` with `numbers[1]` instead of starting from index 0. This will miss the first element and can give the wrong result if the first element is the maximum.
2. **factorial function**: Uses `i < n` instead of `i <= n` in the loop, so it calculates `(n-1)!` instead of `n!`.
3. **countEven function**: Actually counts odd numbers, not even numbers, because it checks `arr[i] % 2 == 1` instead of `arr[i] % 2 == 0`.

### GDB Debugging Steps

1. **Start GDB:**
   ```bash
   make debug-logic
   # or
   gdb ./logic_error_example
   ```

2. **Set breakpoints:**
   ```gdb
   (gdb) break main
   (gdb) break findMax
   (gdb) break factorial
   (gdb) break countEvenHelper
   ```

3. **Run the program:**
   ```gdb
   (gdb) run
   ```

4. **Step through the code:**
   ```gdb
   (gdb) next          # Step over function calls
   (gdb) step          # Step into function calls
   (gdb) continue      # Continue execution
   (gdb) print variable_name  # Print variable values
   (gdb) info locals   # Show local variables
   ```

5. **Example debugging session:**
   ```gdb
   (gdb) break findMax
   (gdb) run
   (gdb) print numbers
   (gdb) print max
   (gdb) next
   (gdb) print i
   (gdb) print numbers[i]
   ```

### Useful GDB Commands

- `break function_name` - Set breakpoint at function
- `break filename:line_number` - Set breakpoint at specific line
- `info breakpoints` - List all breakpoints
- `delete breakpoint_number` - Delete a breakpoint
- `print expression` - Print value of expression
- `display variable` - Print variable every time execution stops
- `info locals` - Show local variables
- `info args` - Show function arguments
- `backtrace` - Show call stack
- `frame number` - Switch to specific frame in call stack

## Debugging with Valgrind

### Memory Leak Example

The `memory_leak_example.cpp` contains several types of memory issues:

1. **Missing destructor**: `MemoryLeakClass` doesn't free allocated memory
2. **Forgotten delete**: `createMemoryLeak()` allocates but never frees
3. **Early return leak**: `createAnotherLeak()` returns without cleanup
4. **Loop leaks**: `leakInLoop()` leaks memory in each iteration
5. **Double free**: `doubleFreeBug()` (commented out to avoid crash)
6. **Use after free**: `useAfterFreeBug()` (commented out to avoid crash)

### Valgrind Debugging Steps

1. **Run with Valgrind:**
   ```bash
   make debug-memory
   # or
   valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ./memory_leak_example
   ```

2. **For detailed output:**
   ```bash
   make debug-memory-detailed
   ```

### Understanding Valgrind Output

Valgrind will show:
- **Definitely lost**: Memory that is definitely leaked
- **Indirectly lost**: Memory lost through pointer chains
- **Possibly lost**: Memory that might be leaked
- **Still reachable**: Memory that's still accessible but not freed

### Example Valgrind Output Analysis

```
==12345== HEAP SUMMARY:
==12345==     in use at exit: 8,044 bytes in 8 blocks
==12345==   total heap usage: 10 allocs, 2 frees, 82,796 bytes allocated
==12345== 
==12345== 4 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 4

==12345==    by 0x109289: createMemoryLeak() (memory_leak_example.cpp:36)
==12345==    by 0x10970D: main (memory_leak_example.cpp:116)
==12345== 
==12345== 4,000 bytes in 5 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 4 of 4
==12345==    at 0x48485C3: operator new[](unsigned long) (in /usr/libexec/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
==12345==    by 0x109401: leakInLoop(int) (memory_leak_example.cpp:67)
==12345==    by 0x1097C0: main (memory_leak_example.cpp:128)
```

This shows:
- 8,044 bytes are definitely lost
- The leaks occurred in several functions, with line numbers and call stacks

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

### Combining GDB and Valgrind

1. **Run with Valgrind to find memory issues:**
   ```bash
   valgrind --vgdb=yes --vgdb-error=0 ./memory_leak_example
   ```

2. **Connect GDB to Valgrind:**
   ```bash
   gdb ./memory_leak_example
   (gdb) target remote | vgdb
   ```

### Debugging Tips

1. **Start with Valgrind** to find memory issues
2. **Use GDB** to step through logic errors
3. **Set breakpoints** at suspicious locations
4. **Print variables** frequently to understand program state
5. **Use conditional breakpoints** for specific conditions
6. **Check the call stack** when errors occur

### Common Debugging Patterns

1. **Logic Errors:**
   - Set breakpoints at function entry
   - Step through loops and conditionals
   - Print variable values at each step
   - Check loop bounds and conditions

2. **Memory Errors:**
   - Run Valgrind first to identify leaks
   - Set breakpoints at allocation/deallocation points
   - Check for missing delete statements
   - Verify destructor implementations

## Cleaning Up

To remove compiled files:
```bash
make clean
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"No debugging symbols found"**: Make sure to compile with `-g` flag
- **Valgrind not found**: Install valgrind package
- **GDB not working**: Ensure program was compiled with debugging symbols
- **Program crashes**: Use GDB to get backtrace and identify crash location

## Next Steps

Once comfortable with these examples:
1. Try fixing the bugs in the code
2. Create your own buggy programs to practice
3. Learn about more advanced GDB features (watchpoints, catchpoints)
4. Explore Valgrind's other tools (Helgrind for threading, Callgrind for profiling)
